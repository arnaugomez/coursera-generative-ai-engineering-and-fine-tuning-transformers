# Overview of LoRA with PyTorch and HuggingFace

## Introduction

- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: A lightweight training technique that significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters in large language models (LLMs).
- **PyTorch and HuggingFace**: Frameworks that facilitate the implementation and training of LoRA in LLMs.

## Key Concepts

### LoRA Technique
- **Functionality**: Inserts new small weights into the model to train them, making the training process faster and more memory efficient.
- **Advantages**: Produces smaller model weights for easier storage and sharing.

### IMDb Dataset
- **Content**: Contains movie reviews useful for binary sentiment classification.
- **Usage**: Utilized to create iterators for training and testing datasets.

## Technical Implementation

### PyTorch Implementation

1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - Traverse IMDb dataset using a predefined class.
   - Convert dataset to map style and perform random splits for training and validation.

2. **Batch Customization**:
   - Use `collate_batch` function to customize batches from individual samples.
   - Convert dataset objects to data loaders with a batch size of 64.

3. **Model Definition**:
   - Define a simple text classifier using embedding layers, ReLU activation, and an output linear layer.

4. **Model Transformation**:
   - Modify the hidden layer to a LoRA model.
   - Implement LoRA with low-rank matrices A and B, and a scaling factor alpha.

5. **Training Process**:
   - Fine-tune the model using `train_model` function with cross-entropy loss and stochastic gradient descent (SGD).
   - Evaluate model performance by plotting loss and accuracy graphs.

6. **Parameter Efficiency**:
   - Store learnable parameters A, B, and alpha to load the model in the future.
   - Highlight the efficiency of LoRA in reducing parameter storage needs.

### HuggingFace Implementation

1. **Model Setup**:
   - Load IMDb dataset and DistilBERT tokenizer.
   - Apply tokenizer to create input IDs and attention masks.

2. **Model Loading**:
   - Load a BERT-like model from HuggingFace's transformer library for fine-tuning.

3. **Configuration**:
   - Define task type and configuration for LoRA.
   - Set rank, scaling factor, and dropout for larger models.

4. **Training Arguments**:
   - Use `TrainingArguments` to encapsulate all hyperparameters and configurations.

5. **Training Process**:
   - Utilize the `Trainer` class for simplified training and evaluation of transformer models.
   - Plot loss versus accuracy graph to validate model improvements.

## Summary

- **LoRA's Role**: Efficiently fine-tunes models using reduced parameters, making it an advantageous technique in model training.
- **Integration with PyTorch and HuggingFace**: Enhances the ease of training and managing large language models by leveraging these frameworks.
