"Describe the purpose of the lesson on Fine-tuning with Hugging Face.","To equip with knowledge to fine-tune models using Hugging Face and PyTorch."
"What is Hugging Face?","An open-source machine learning platform tailored for NLP applications."
"What is the transformers library used for?","It's tailored for natural language processing (NLP) applications."
"What function is used to load built-in datasets in Hugging Face?","The `load_dataset` function."
"What is the structure of the Yelp review dataset?","A list-like object containing user reviews and metadata."
"What key information does each review in the Yelp dataset contain?","`text` (review content) and `label` (star rating from 1 to 5)."
"Which tokenizer is suggested for handling the Yelp dataset?","A BERT tokenizer."
"What are `input_ids` in tokenization?","Token indices for each review text."
"What is generated for each sample apart from `input_ids`?","Attention masks."
"How is data converted for training in PyTorch?","Convert data into PyTorch tensors with keys like `labels`, `input_ids`, `token_type_ids`, and `attention_mask`."
"What model is loaded for fine-tuning in the example?","A pre-trained BERT classification model with five classes."
"What parameter specifies the number of classes in the BERT model?","The `num_labels` parameter."
"What optimizer is used for training the BERT model?","The AdamW optimizer from PyTorch."
"What are the SFT Trainer's advantages?","Simplifies and automates training tasks, making the process efficient and less error-prone."
"What is the objective of the Masked Language Model Task?","To predict a masked word using a transformer model."
"What dataset is suggested for fine-tuning a masked language model?","The IMDB dataset."
"What does the SFT Trainer configuration require?","Parameters: model, training arguments, dataset, and specific field key for training."
"What is used for masked language predictions?","A pipeline object (mask filler)."
"What does the key `token_str` represent in predictions?","The predicted token."
"What does the key `score` indicate in predictions?","Likelihood of the predicted token, ordered by likelihood."
