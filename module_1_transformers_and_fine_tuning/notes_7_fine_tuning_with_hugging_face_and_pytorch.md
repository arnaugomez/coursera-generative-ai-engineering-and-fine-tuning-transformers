# Fine-tuning with Hugging Face and PyTorch

## Introduction

Welcome to the lesson on **Fine-tuning with Hugging Face**. By the end of this session, you will be equipped with the knowledge to:

- Describe how to fine-tune your model using Hugging Face and PyTorch.
- Utilize the **Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer (SFT Trainer)** to fine-tune your model efficiently.

## Overview of Hugging Face

- **Hugging Face** is an open-source machine learning platform.
- It includes a **transformers library** tailored for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
- It allows users to share machine learning models and datasets and showcase their work.
- Built-in datasets can be loaded using the `load_dataset` function.

## Example: Loading the Yelp Review Dataset

1. **Dataset Structure**:

   - The Yelp review dataset is structured as a list-like object containing user reviews and metadata.
   - Each review is a dictionary with keys such as `text` (review content) and `label` (star rating from 1 to 5).

2. **Tokenization**:

   - Use a **BERT tokenizer** to tokenize, pad, and truncate reviews, handling variable-length sequences efficiently.
   - The tokenizer function extracts the text from the dataset and applies the tokenizer.
   - The result is that each review text is converted to token indices, stored under the key `input_ids`.
   - Other parameters, such as **attention masks**, are generated for each sample.

3. **Data Preparation**:
   - Text information can be removed, and the label key can be renamed.
   - Convert the data into **PyTorch tensors** with keys like `labels`, `input_ids`, `token_type_ids`, and `attention_mask`.
   - Create a data loader for training and testing datasets, enabling batch iteration.

## Fine-tuning a Pre-trained BERT Model

1. **Loading the Model**:

   - Load a pre-trained BERT classification model with five classes designed for sequence classification.
   - The `num_labels` parameter specifies the number of classes, determining the neurons in the final layer.

2. **Training Setup**:

   - Create an optimizer and learning rate scheduler using the **AdamW optimizer** from PyTorch.
   - Define a training function and an evaluation function to assess model performance post-fine-tuning.
   - Train the model, observing loss reduction after each epoch.

3. **Supervised Fine-tuning Trainer (SFT Trainer)**:
   - The SFT Trainer simplifies and automates training tasks, making the process efficient and less error-prone.
   - It's advantageous compared to manual training with PyTorch alone.

## Masked Language Model Task

1. **Objective**:

   - Predict a masked word using a transformer model.

2. **Process**:

   - Load a masked language model and fine-tune it using the SFT trainer.
   - Use datasets like the **IMDB dataset** for fine-tuning.
   - Define training arguments, including parameters such as learning rate and number of epochs.

3. **SFT Trainer Configuration**:

   - Define the SFT trainer object with parameters: model, training arguments, dataset, and specific field key for training.
   - Train the model and observe the loss for every epoch.

4. **Prediction**:
   - Create a pipeline object (mask filler) for predictions.
   - Input text, such as "This is a [MASK] movie!", to get predictions.
   - The output is an iterable object where the key `token_str` contains the predicted token and `score` indicates likelihood, ordered by likelihood.

## Recap

- Hugging Face is a versatile platform for NLP applications using the transformers library.
- You learned how to load datasets, apply tokenization, and prepare data for training.
- Fine-tuning a pre-trained BERT model involves configuring optimizers, schedulers, and leveraging the SFT trainer for efficient training.
- You can perform masked language predictions using pipeline objects to get likelihood-based predictions.

This lesson provided a comprehensive overview of fine-tuning models using Hugging Face and PyTorch, equipping you with the tools to implement these techniques in your machine learning projects.
