# Fine-Tuning and Machine Learning Platforms

## Summary and Highlights

Congratulations! You have completed this lesson. At this point in the course, you know that:

### Fine-Tuning in Machine Learning

- **Fine-tuning** is the process of adapting a pretrained model for specific tasks or use cases.
- **Key components involved in fine-tuning:**
  - **Collate Function:** Tokenizes the dataset.
  - **Transformer-based Model Class:** Defines classification in PyTorch.
  - **Forward Method:** Applies embeddings to the input.
  - **Train_model Function:** Trains a transformer model.

- **Benefits of Fine-Tuning:**
  - **Efficiency:** Enhances efficiency and saves time and computational resources compared to training models from scratch.
  - **Transfer Learning:** Facilitates the transfer of learning from one task to another.
  - **Tailored Responses:** Provides task-specific adaptation and responses.

### Hugging Face and PyTorch

- **Hugging Face** is an open-source machine learning platform with a built-in transformers library for natural language processing (NLP) applications.
  - **Datasets:** Built-in datasets can be loaded using the `load_dataset` function.

- **Comparison Between Hugging Face and PyTorch:**
