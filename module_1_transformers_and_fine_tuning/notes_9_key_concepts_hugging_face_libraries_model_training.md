## Popular Hugging Face Features

**Question 1: Which of the following is the most popular feature of Hugging Face?**

- **Transformers library**: The Transformers library is one of the most popular features of Hugging Face, known for its vast collection of pre-trained models for natural language processing tasks.

Other mentioned features:
- Tokenizers library
- Datasets library
- Building neural networks

## Fine-Tuning Approaches

**Question 2: Which fine-tuning approach is applied for learning to predict missing words in a large, unlabeled dataset?**

- **Self-supervised fine-tuning**: This approach allows models to learn from the context within the data itself, such as predicting missing or masked words without requiring labeled data.

Other approaches listed:
- Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)
- Supervised fine-tuning
- Direct preference optimization (DPO)

## Code Snippet Analysis

**Question 3: Select the correct statement regarding the given code snippet.**

The given code snippet is:

```python
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self, num_class, vocab_size, freeze=True, nhead=2, dim_feedforward=128, \
                 num_layers=2, dropout=0.1, activation="relu", classifier_dropout=0.1):
        super().__init__()

        self.emb = nn.Embedding.from_pretrained(glove_embedding.vectors, freeze=freeze)
        embedding_dim = self.emb.embedding_dim

        self.pos_encoder = PositionalEncoding(d_model=embedding_dim, dropout=dropout, 
                                              vocab_size=vocab_size)

        encoder_layer = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=embedding_dim, nhead=nhead, 
                                                   dim_feedforward=dim_feedforward, dropout=dropout)

        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layer, num_layers=num_layers)
        self.classifier = nn.Linear(embedding_dim, num_class)
        self.d_model = embedding_dim
```

- **Correct Statement**: This code snippet indicates the constructor that initializes the text classifier with configurations such as the number of classes, vocabulary size, and transformer settings.

Other options:
- Training a transformer model with an optimizer and loss criterion
- Converting dataset into map-style datasets and performing a random split
- Preprocessing text for machine learning

## SFT Trainer Functionality

**Question 4: Which statement is correct regarding an SFT Trainer?**

- **It simplifies and automates training tasks**: The SFT Trainer streamlines the process of training models, making it easier to handle various tasks without delving deeply into complex configurations.

Other functionalities listed:
- Evaluating the modelâ€™s performance
- Extracting text from the dataset
- Determining the number of neurons in the final layer
