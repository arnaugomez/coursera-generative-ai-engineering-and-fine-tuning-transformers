# Fine Tuning with PyTorch

## Overview

This lesson focuses on **fine-tuning** a pre-trained model using PyTorch, a key technique in deep learning that adapts pre-trained models for specific tasks or use cases. The lesson covers the preparation of datasets, model definition, and the fine-tuning process, including both the complete model and its final layer.

## Key Concepts

- **Fine Tuning**: The process of adapting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks or adjust it to a new dataset.
- **PyTorch**: A popular open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing.

## Datasets

1. **IMDB Dataset**:

   - Contains 50,000 samples of movie reviews.
   - Binary classification: Positive and Negative reviews.

2. **AG News Dataset**:
   - Comprises 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples.
   - Four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Science & Technology.

## Fine-Tuning Process

### Pre-training and Fine-Tuning Strategy

- **Pre-train** the model on the AG News dataset to develop a robust understanding of language in various contexts.
- **Fine-tune** the model on the IMDB dataset to specialize it in sentiment analysis for movie reviews.

### Data Preparation

- **Load Datasets** into test and train iterators.
- **Tokenizer**: Define a tokenizer and load pre-trained GloVe embeddings.
- **Vocabulary Building**: Create a vocabulary object from GloVe embeddings, assigning index values and setting a default index for tokens.

### Model Definition

- **Transformer Based Model Class**: Define the encoder model class for classification in PyTorch.
  - **Components**: Includes embeddings, positional encoding, transformer encoder, and a linear classifier.
  - **Pre-trained Word Embeddings**: Use GloVe for the embedding layer.
  - **Forward Method**: Applies embeddings to input, adds positional encoding, processes data through the transformer encoder, averages data, and classifies using the classifier.

### Training and Evaluation

- **Train Model Function**:

  - Trains a transformer model with the provided optimizer and loss criteria.
  - Evaluates model performance on validation data and saves the model if validation accuracy improves.

- **Predict Function**:
  - Takes text input and a text pipeline to preprocess text for machine learning.
  - Uses a pre-trained model to predict text labels for classification.

### Fine-Tuning the Model

- **Complete Model Fine-Tuning**:

  - Create a model object with PyTorch.
  - Load parameters from a pre-trained model on the AG News dataset.
  - Adjust the number of neurons in the final layer according to the dataset being fine-tuned.

- **Final Layer Fine-Tuning**:
  - Freeze all layers except the final layer by setting their `requires_grad` attribute to `False`.
  - Focus optimization on fewer parameters to speed up training.

### Performance Considerations

- **Full Model Fine-Tuning**: Achieves approximately 90% accuracy on validation data.
- **Final Layer Fine-Tuning**: Training is faster, but performance is significantly worse.

### Trade-offs

- A trade-off exists between the speed of training and the performance of the model when choosing to fine-tune the entire model versus just the final layer.

## Conclusion

This lesson provides an understanding of fine-tuning in machine learning using PyTorch, emphasizing the importance of adapting pre-trained models to specific datasets and tasks while considering performance trade-offs.
