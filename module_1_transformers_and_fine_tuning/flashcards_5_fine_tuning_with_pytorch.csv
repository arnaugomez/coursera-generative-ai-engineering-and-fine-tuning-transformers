"Define Fine Tuning in the context of deep learning.","The process of adapting a pre-trained model to perform specific tasks or adjust it to a new dataset."
"What is PyTorch?","A popular open-source machine learning library used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing."
"What are the characteristics of the IMDB Dataset?","Contains 50,000 samples of movie reviews and is used for binary classification: Positive and Negative reviews."
"How many classes are in the AG News Dataset and what are they?","There are four classes: World, Sports, Business, and Science & Technology."
"What is the purpose of Pre-training and Fine-Tuning Strategy in the lesson?","To pre-train the model on the AG News dataset for language understanding and fine-tune it on the IMDB dataset for sentiment analysis."
"What role does the tokenizer play in data preparation?","Defines a tokenizer and loads pre-trained GloVe embeddings for vocabulary building."
"What is the function of the Transformer Based Model Class in PyTorch?","Defines the encoder model class for classification, including components like embeddings, positional encoding, transformer encoder, and a linear classifier."
"What does the Forward Method in the model definition do?","Applies embeddings to input, adds positional encoding, processes data through the transformer encoder, averages data, and classifies using the classifier."
"What is the purpose of the Train Model Function?","Trains a transformer model with the optimizer and loss criteria, evaluates performance on validation data, and saves the model if validation accuracy improves."
"What does the Predict Function accomplish?","Preprocesses text for machine learning and uses a pre-trained model to predict text labels for classification."
"Explain Complete Model Fine-Tuning.","Involves creating a model object with PyTorch, loading parameters from a pre-trained model, and adjusting the final layer neurons according to the new dataset."
"What is Final Layer Fine-Tuning?","Freezing all layers except the final layer by setting their requires_grad attribute to False, focusing optimization on fewer parameters."
"What is the performance of Full Model Fine-Tuning on validation data?","Achieves approximately 90% accuracy."
"Discuss the trade-offs in model fine-tuning.","Trade-off between the speed of training and the performance of the model when fine-tuning the entire model versus just the final layer."
