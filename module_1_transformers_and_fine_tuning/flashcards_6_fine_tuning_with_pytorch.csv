"Define fine tuning in machine learning.","Fine tuning is the process of adapting a pre-trained model for specific tasks or use cases."  
"What is the primary objective of the lesson on Fine Tuning with PyTorch?","To prepare the dataset for loading and model definition, and fine-tune the complete model and its final layer."  
"How many samples are there in the IMDB Dataset?","The IMDB Dataset contains 50,000 samples of movie reviews."  
"What type of classification is the IMDB Dataset used for?","It is a binary classification dataset with two classes: positive and negative."  
"How many training and test samples are in the AG News Dataset?","The AG News Dataset contains 120,000 training samples and 7,600 test samples."  
"List the four classes in the AG News Dataset.","The classes are world sports, business, and science and technology."  
"What is the pre-training approach discussed?","Pre-train the model on the AG News dataset to build a robust understanding of language in context from diverse topics."  
"What are the steps involved in preparing the IMDB dataset?","Define a class to load the dataset, load into test and train iterators, define a tokenizer, load GloVe embeddings, build vocabulary, and perform data transformations."  
"What is the purpose of the collate function in data transformation?","The collate function tokenizes the dataset, converts tokens to sequences of token indices, and transforms sequences and class labels into tensors."  
"What is the role of the forward method in the model definition?","The forward method applies embeddings, adds positional encoding, passes data through the transformer encoder, averages the data, and classifies it using a linear classifier."  
"What is evaluated during the training process?","Model performance on a validation dataset, printing loss per epoch, and optionally saving the model and performance metrics if validation accuracy improves."  
"How is the output layer adjusted when fine-tuning the IMDB dataset?","Adjust the number of neurons in the final layer from four to two to match the IMDB dataset's categories."  
"How does complete model fine-tuning compare to final layer fine-tuning in terms of performance?","Complete model fine-tuning achieves approximately 90% accuracy on validation data, while final layer fine-tuning is significantly worse."  
"What trade-off is mentioned regarding fine-tuning the entire model?","The trade-off between better performance when tuning the entire model and faster training with final layer fine-tuning."  
"What did you learn about fine-tuning in the lesson?","Fine-tuning involves adapting a pre-trained model for specific tasks, requiring data preparation, model definition, training, and evaluation, with a focus on speed vs. accuracy."
